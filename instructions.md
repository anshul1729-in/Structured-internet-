# Project Brief: Tech Navigator
This web app should present technology domains from the attached PDF (“Tech Learning Overview.pdf”)—such as computer architecture, programming & software development, operating systems, etc.—and allow users to explore definitions, subtopics and recommended study times. Use the PDF as your data source and extract each domain’s definition and key topics (for example, computer architecture covers how CPU, memory, storage and I/O devices communicate to perform processing). Build a React app with pages for Home, Domain List, Domain Detail, and a Dashboard.
